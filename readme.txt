Project Description

This project demonstrates the usage of the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for natural language processing tasks. It includes tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization of text data using NLTK and sklearn.
Features of the Project

    NLTK Setup:
        Downloads essential NLTK packages such as stopwords and punkt.

    Tokenization:
        Word Tokenization: Breaks a sentence into individual words.
        Sentence Tokenization: Breaks text into individual sentences.

    Stopword Removal:
        Uses the NLTK English stopword corpus to filter out common words like "the", "is", etc.
        Extracts meaningful words from a sentence.

    Text Vectorization:
        Implements a bag-of-words model using CountVectorizer from sklearn.
        Demonstrates text transformation into numerical arrays for machine learning or text analysis.

Libraries Used

    nltk: For natural language processing tasks like tokenization and stopword removal.
    sklearn.feature_extraction.text: For creating the bag-of-words representation of text data.

Code Workflow

    Import required libraries and download NLTK resources.
    Tokenize text into words and sentences using NLTK.
    Filter meaningful words by removing stopwords.
    Use CountVectorizer to transform sentences into numerical representations.

How to Run

    Clone or download the script.
    Ensure Python 3.x is installed along with the required libraries:

pip install nltk scikit-learn

Run the script using:

    python NLTK_project.py

    The output includes tokenized text, filtered meaningful words, and numerical text representations.

Example
Input

sentence = "Hi there! This is my world."

Output

    Word Tokenization: ['Hi', 'there', '!', 'This', 'is', 'my', 'world', '.']
    Sentence Tokenization: ['Hi there!', 'This is my world.']
    Meaningful Words: ['Hi', '!', 'This', 'world', '.']
    Bag-of-Words Matrix:

    [[0, 0, 1, 1],
     [0, 1, 1, 1],
     [1, 1, 1, 1]]

Future Enhancements

    Expand the stopword corpus to include custom stopwords.
    Include stemming or lemmatization for more advanced text preprocessing.
    Integrate advanced vectorization techniques such as TF-IDF or Word2Vec.
